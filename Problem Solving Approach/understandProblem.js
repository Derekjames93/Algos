//=================================================================
// write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
//=================================================================

    //1. Can I restate the problem in my own words
    "implement addition"
    //2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
        //-ints?
        //-floats?
        //-what about string for large numbers?
    //3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    //4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?
    //5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?


//My Answer
function sum (num1,num2){
    return num1 + num2
}

console.log(sum(1,2))
